UNTITLED TANK GAME
Copyright Aiden Trimble 2024

OVERVIEW
This was my final project for DAGD 255, and the project that made me want to continue pursuing game programming. This game was designed for my professor.

PROCESS
The main focus of the project was meeting the requirements for a full grade, but also I wanted to try and add in a scaling level system.

CHALLENGES  AND SOLUTIONS
The biggest obstacle I faced during the development was a bug that even the professor didn’t really understand what was happening. When you started the game, everything would just freeze and then eventually crash. I somehow managed to figure out that the game was loading itself infinitely and I just had to fix that. Figuring that out was what made me love this project and want to continue programming games. Another problem was the fact that the game didn’t really have art. Processing didn’t have built-in tools to make programmer art quickly like GameMaker does, so I just settled with having everything be different colored squares.

REFLECTIONS
This was my first programming assignment that I really fell in love with, and it encouraged me to continue down that path. I distinctly remember being disappointed when the due date came as I really wanted to do a little more with the game.
